# flax-kotahi-demo-next

Version of the Flax/Kotahi demo that uses Next.js and React. This also uses components from Pubsweet.

## positives

- this lets us use React
- Next.js has pretty developed ISR (with integration with Netlify or Vercel)

## negatives

- probably slower than straight Eleventy?

## worth remembering

- intro to ISR concepts: https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/05/17/incremental-static-regeneration-building-static-sites-a-little-at-a-time/
- pretty good intro to ISR on Next.js: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/
